#This property determines whether a circuit breaker will be used to track health and to short-circuit requests if it trips. It's default value is true hence marking it as false. We will do practice with circuit in next coding exercise
hystrix.command.default.circuitBreaker.enabled=false

#This property determines whether a call to HystrixCommand.getFallback() will be attempted when failure or rejection occurs.
hystrix.command.default.fallback.enabled=true

#This property sets the time in milliseconds after which the caller will observe a timeout and walk away from the command execution. Hystrix marks the HystrixCommand as a TIMEOUT, and performs fallback logic. Note that there is configuration for turning off timeouts per-command, if that is desired (see command.timeout.enabled).
#Note: Timeouts will fire on HystrixCommand.queue(), even if the caller never calls get() on the resulting Future. Before Hystrix 1.4.0, only calls to get() triggered the timeout mechanism to take effect in such a case.
hystrix.command.default.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds=500
